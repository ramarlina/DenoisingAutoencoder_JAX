# DenoisingAutoencoder_JAX

Denoising Autoencoder for unsupervised learning of binary representation of inputs data.

Borrowing the idea of binary hidden units from Geoff Hinton's RBMs and Pascal Vincent's Denoising Autoencoders with tied weights.

Binary hidden units are sampled from a distribution learned from the input data.
